# ColivingApp

Do you have housemates?
Is it difficult to organize yourselves? To keep track of everything you need?
Are you looking for an easy way to manage your house?

The Coliving app is here to make it easy to share home. 
Each home has its own house group where everyone can interact. Everyone that lives on the house should be on the house group so the app works best.
On Coliving app, everyone on the house group can add some item on the shopping list, this way it's harder to miss something.
Coliving also helps to keep track of the house's costs. Each cost has its own category, person responsible and date. This way it's easy to know wich category has taken more money and to check if the finances are all right.
